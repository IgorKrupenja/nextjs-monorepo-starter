# Kollekt front-end starter

## Inital setup

1. Make sure you have Node v18 installed. You can install [directly](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
2. Install `pnpm` and `turborepo` globally: `npm install -g pnpm && pnpm install -g turbo`.
3. Run `pnpm install` in the root directory to install all dependencies.

## Building Next.js projects

1. Run `pnpm build` in the root directory to build all Next.js projects.

This will build the two sample Next.js projects and put built outputs in the `apps/landing-web/.next` and `apps/web/.next` directories.

## Next.js and Docker
